Nearest Sum Tool
The Nearest Sum Tool is a Python script that helps users find the subset of given numbers that has a sum closest to a target sum. This tool utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nearest sum and identify the subset of numbers contributing to that sum.

Welcome to the NearestSumTool wiki!

## Features

Efficient Algorithm: Utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nearest sum.
User Input: Allows users to input the list of numbers and the target sum.
Flexible Usage: Can be easily integrated into other projects or used standalone from the command line.
Usage

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Installation

* Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/vijaysahuofficial/nearest-sum-tool.git`

* Navigate to the project directory:

`cd nearest-sum-tool`

## Usage Instructions

* Run the script nearest_sum_tool.py using Python:

`python nearest_sum_tool.py`


* Follow the prompts to input the list of numbers and the target sum.

* The tool will calculate the nearest sum and display the result, including the subset of numbers contributing to the nearest sum.


Acknowledgements
The Nearest Sum Tool was inspired by the need for an efficient algorithm to find the subset of numbers with a sum closest to a target sum. Special thanks to the Python community for their valuable contributions and feedback.
